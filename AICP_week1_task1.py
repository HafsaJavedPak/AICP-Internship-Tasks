""""A school keeps records of the weights of each pupil. 
The weight, in kilograms, of each pupil isrecorded on the first day of term. 
Input and store the weights and names recorded for a class of30 pupils. 
You must store the weights in a one-dimensional array and the names in another one-dimensional array. 
All the weights must be validated on entry and any invalid weights rejected. 
Youmust decide your own validation rules. You may assume that the pupilsâ€™ names are unique. 
Outputthe names and weights of the pupils in the class"""
